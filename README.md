# Stock Trading Platform with Machine Learning

## Core Idea
We intend to create a website that allows users to invest in various stocks using machine learning models to execute trades on the user's behalf without human intervention.

## Project Overview
We plan to develop four models from our end that users can deploy. Additionally, we will provide a feature where developers can upload their machine learning models to generate buy or sell signals.

To facilitate this, we are building a marketplace where users can purchase models from developers, similar to the concept of smallcase.

## Features
As discussed in our meeting, our platform will include the following features:
- **Statistics Page:** Users can view statistics related to their portfolio, including past performance and other relevant details.
- **Invoice Page:** Users can review their transaction history and invoices.

## Prototype
